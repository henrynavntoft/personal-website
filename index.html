                        <p>During my first semester, I remade the Beerwalks Copenhagen webpage using semantic HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript. The redesign aimed to enhance the website's interactivity, functionality,
                            and accessibility, effectively promoting Beerwalks Copenhagen as a unique experience for
                            beer enthusiasts. We also had fun working with video, showcasing Beerwalks Copenhagen.

                        <h3>Copenhagen Cartel</h3>
                        <p>During my second semester, I made a landing page for Copenhagen Cartel, which sells
                            eco-friendly and sustainable goods. The visually appealing and user-friendly website is
                            designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a responsive design and interactive
                            elements (which is now inactive), which promote the company's mission and showcase its
                            products.

                        <h3>Hacked Hogwarts</h3>
                        <p>During my third and current semester, I developed Hacked Hogwarts, a web application that
                            simulates a cyber attack on Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Through basic
                            JavaScript techniques such as filtering and sorting, I developed a user interface that
                            enables users to interact with the simulated cyber attack. This project helped me enhance my
                            JavaScript programming skills and gain experience in creating dynamic web applications.

                        <h3>Tasklist - EdX course</h3>
                        <p>
                            I developed a task list project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during a HarvardX course.
                            The project allowed users to store tasks in local storage and was designed to be
                            user-friendly and interactive. It helped me enhance my JavaScript programming skills and
                            gain experience in creating dynamic web applications.
