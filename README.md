The website has a simple, user-friendly design with intuitive navigation. It is divided into three sections:

About: A brief introduction about me, my background, and my design philosophy.

Projects: A collection of my work, including project descriptions and links to their repositories or live demos.

Resume: A link to download my resume in PDF format.

The website features a responsive design and a theme switcher for toggling between light and dark mode.
